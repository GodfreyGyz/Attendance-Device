# Attendance-Device

Once in a while when we travel to some places in a group, either it't with a bunch of friends, or it's within a travel group where people don't know about each other at all, we would always have to spend some time on finding out who had turned up and who's not after individual activities. This *Attendance-Device* is trying to tease this problem with the quite mature RFID technology which is quite popular in the IoT world, especially in the storage management and goods delivery. What if we give each of the group member an RFID tag and scan them when we need to do a head count?

### Hardware Setup

The final version of the device is made up of the current software. I've tried some other hardware combination and I've put them in the [*What Works and What Doesn't*]() session and written down why I decided not to use them.
